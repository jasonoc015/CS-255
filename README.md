# CS-255

## Client
The client in this scenario was DriverPass. They wanted us to design a system that provides an online interface for students who want help passing their driving tests. The system offered online courses, practie exams, and even a reservation system for students to schedule a road lesson with an instructor.

## What I did well
In the business requirements document, I disect the interview and generate as many unique requirements, conditions, and limitations that the interview supplied. These requiremnts should be ample information for the development team to begin the design phase.

## Revisions
I particularly like my class diagram. I think it is thoughtful, organized, and uses best practices to represent the system. My time is limited, so I was not able to complete the associated methods for each of the classes. If I were to revise anything, It would be that. The data members of a class give you really only half of an outline for a class. The other half is the associated member functions. They provide an outline for what sort of behavior an functionality each class if going to have. 

## User's needs
In the interview, we did not get to hear from a student user, but we did get to hear from several administrators who will effectively be users of the system. There were a lot of things that the admins suggested and asked for. A main request was security. Throughout the business requirements document, you can see that the user requests are a large influencer towards the listed requiremnts. In particular, the security requirements are a direct response to the admin's request that security be a priority.

## Approach
In the future, I would use a format similar to this. You have a sit-down with the relevant stakeholders and ask them a broad range of rellevant questions that have been prepared in advance. You listen to the stakeholders and ask clarifying questions where necessary. A transcription of the interview is definitely going to be useful to refer to later. After the interview, the analyist team should compile their findings from the interview into a format that resembles the business requirements document listed here. Where there are different sections that detail different types of requirements. From there, you can begin dicussions with the dsesign team about how to bring these requirements to life.
